    <h3>An <em>amazing</em> piece of history is about to be made.</h3>
    <p>Prepare yourself for this Ham Sammy is nothing to mess around with!
        Best prepared fresh.
    </p>
    <p>Here as follows is my personal <em>favorite</em> recipe. I make it quite often.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients for the sammich</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pieces of your choice of bread</li>
        <li>4 thin slices of ham</li>
        <li>Pickles!!!</li>
        <li>2 slices of muenster cheese</li>
        <li>Mayo</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Steps to delish</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab your 2 pieces of bread and slather on mayo. 
        Dont worry about overdoing it as that is very hard.</li>
        <li>Tear your cheese into little bits and then put on top piece of bread. 
        Sprinkle heavily across.</li>
        <li>Add your pickles next, the more the better.</li>
        <li>Finally, add your sliced ham. Put bottom piece of bread on.</li>
        <p>Enjoy; Serve with potato chips or beans. <em>BEANS!</em></p>
        <p>Another good recommendation is putting sandwich in microwave and letting the cheese melt.</p>
    </ol>
